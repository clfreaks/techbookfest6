# Preface

## About Lisp

Lisp was originally born as a notation for computational models, and it was later discovered that it could be implemented and used as programming language, giving the language a unique origin.
Its history is quite old, with more than 60 years having passed since the idea was first proposed by John McCarthy.
Despite its old origins, Lisp remains an active and widely-used language, with various dialects continuing to be created and utilized on a wide range of platforms.
This can be attributed to the fact that Lisp's basic principles are very compact, making implementation easy, and that the language is easily extensible.
As a result, Lisp has been used for experimenting with the latest language features and as an embedded language in applications.

Among the Lisp dialects, Clojure and Common Lisp stand out as those that are currently being used for actual product development.
Clojure is a JVM language, allowing for interoperability with existing Java libraries and running on a wide range of platforms.
Common Lisp, on the other hand, has its language specification defined by ANSI (American National Standards Institute), and programs written in accordance with the ANSI standard have portability and are guaranteed to work in the future.
For these reasons, Common Lisp has been used in fields such as industry, military, space development, and AI research.

Among the authors of this book are members of Pocket Change, a company developing an electronic money platform. Here, too, Common Lisp is being used for payment systems and backend web applications.

## Purpose and Target Audience of This Book

This book consists of explanations of recent development flows and tools in Common Lisp, as well as specific project examples. While there are a fair number of books on the language itself, there has been a lack of concrete guidance on how to set up an environment and create projects. This book aims to cover that gap, leaving detailed explanations of the language itself to other publications.

The target audience for this book includes those who are interested in Common Lisp and have researched or can research the language specifications but are unsure how to proceed with project development, as well as those who are considering entering the world of Common Lisp. Additionally, it is expected to be useful for those who are already developing with Common Lisp and want to learn about recent tools.
